Dungeons is a Paper plugin for creating, editing, and running configurable dungeon content with queueing, teams, triggers, functions, difficulty scaling, and loot table rewards.

## Quick Start

1. Place `Dungeons-<version>.jar` in your server `plugins/` directory.
2. Start the server once to generate runtime files under `plugins/Dungeons/`.
3. Configure global settings in `plugins/Dungeons/config.yml`.
4. Create or edit dungeon content with `/dungeon` editor commands.
5. Start a run with `/dungeon play <dungeon>[:difficulty]`.

## Requirements

- Java 25
- Paper 26.x

## Build From Source

Use Java 25. HauntedPlatform is resolved from GitHub Packages; set `PACKAGES_USER` and `PACKAGES_TOKEN` (with `read:packages`) for a fresh local Maven cache. The committed `.mvn/settings.xml` reads these variables.

```bash
./mvnw -B -ntp verify
```

Output jar: `target/Dungeons-<version>.jar`

## Release workflow

From clean `main`, run `./tools/release/update-version patch --pr` to open a reviewed version PR. CI tests the PR; after merge, GitHub Actions publishes the Maven package, verifies that it resolves, and creates the tag and downloadable release jar with a SHA-256 checksum. See [release tooling](tools/release/README.md).
